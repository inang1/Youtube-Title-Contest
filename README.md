# Youtube-Title-Contest

Created a webscraper to pull the top 200 most viewed videos from the search results of "iphone battery repair" to help my friend create a clickbait title for his new video. 
The output is a wordcloud with the most commonly used words in the title:

One of the files is uses the YoutubeAPI to pull results, but is unfinished due to Youtube's limits on the number of results that can be pulled at once. I might go back to it when I have the time to fix it to use the pagination to pull results. 

The other two Jupyter notebooks contain the code for the wordcloud.
